### Look here if this is your first time using Git

For your first time, be sure to configure git on your machine (this only needs to be done once). Open whichever shell terminal you prefer (e.g. 'Terminal' on Apple OS, 'Git Bash' on Windows), and enter the following commands:

`git config --global user.name "yourName"`

`git config --global user.email "yourEmail"`
