# NutNet2020_Workshop
This repository is for practicing the basic Git workflow. Feel free to push to it at anytime. Please do not add large data files. 

### Look here if this is your first time using Git

For your first time, be sure to configure Git on your machine (this only needs to be done once). Open whichever shell terminal you prefer (e.g. 'Terminal' on Apple OS, 'Git Bash' on Windows), and enter the following commands, replacing 'yourName' and 'yourEmail' as needed:

`git config --global user.name "yourName"`

`git config --global user.email "yourEmail"`

### Once you're ready to go...

1. Use `git pull` to ensure your local repository is up to date.

2. Create a new R file in the 'Analyses' folder, and name it something unique. 

3. Using either a shell terminal or RStudio, commit and push your new file to the online repo. 

4. Refresh the Github repo to ensure it worked!
